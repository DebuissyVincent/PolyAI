# PolyAI
PolyAI is a personnal project striving to bring a polyvalent and efficient video-game AI system to Unity. Mostly for my own use I do wish it could help others in the making of games or even your own AI system.

# How To Use
/!\Work in progress/!\
Place any of the PolyAgentSimple or PolyAgentBT in the scene and add to them a TaskSetup (for simple agent) or BTSetup (for behaviour tree agent)
Basic/example TaskSetup and BTSetup will be given for you to see how create your own.

You can implement your own logic and behaviours by creating a new script child of TaskSetup or BTSetup.
